# fibonacci_factorial.py

Small Python script with two utility functions I wrote while practicing algorithms:

- `factorial(n)` — recursive factorial implementation that returns `n!`.
- `fibonacci(n)` — builds and returns a list containing the first `n` Fibonacci numbers (starts from `[0, 1]`).

This script includes a simple interactive prompt so you can run it directly.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+ (no external packages required)
